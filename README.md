## Why is the code so bad?
This was a simple day project to take my mind off a recent passing, You could contribute if you wish! I'd love some PRs!

## Does it use compression?
Yes, it uses brotli compression to store content.

## What's "private"?
Private is a feature that allows images to have a timeout, meaning they will no longer be accessible after a certain period of time.

## How do I use this?
Fill out the config with all your desired settings, add your SSL certificate files (cert.pem & key.pem), cargo build, and off you go!

## Do you have a ShareX config for it?
I do!
